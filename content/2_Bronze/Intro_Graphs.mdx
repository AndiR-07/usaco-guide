Note: Graphs will become a key topic in higher divisions. For Bronze, graphs are
just a nice way to think about the structure of our data.

Graphs can be used to represent many things, from images to wireless signals,
but one of the simplest analogies is to a map. Consider a map with several
cities and bidirectional roads connecting the cities. Some problems relating to
graphs are:

1.  Is city $A$ connected to city $B$? Consider a region to be a group of cities
    such that each city in the group can reach any other city in said group, but
    no other cities. How many regions are in this map, and which cities are in
    which region? (Silver)

2.  What's the shortest distance I have to travel to get from city $A$ to city
    $B$? (Gold)

For now, it suffices to learn how graphs are represented (usually **adjacency
lists**).

## What Does a Bronze Graph Problem Look Like?

All of the problems below fall into at least one of the following two
categories:

- The graph's structure is special (it's a tree, path, or a cycle).
- To solve the problem, all you need to do is iterate over the adjacency list of
  every vertex.

Knowing [DFS](/silver/dfs) can be helpful but it should not be required.

## Example - Grass Planting

<FocusProblem problem="tutorial" />

<Spoiler title="Hint 1">
Find a lower bound for the answer, and try to prove it!
</Spoiler>
<Spoiler title="Intended Solution">
Let $\texttt{deg}[i]$ represent the degree of node $i$: the number of paths
connecting the node. Then, considering that node, and that node alone, you would
need $\texttt{deg}[i]+1$ grass types. This is because you would need
$\texttt{deg}[i]$ for each of the adjacent nodes, and $1$ for the node itself.
It can be shown that the tree can also be colored accordingly in
$\max(\texttt{deg}[i])+1$ colors.

<Spoiler title="Alternate Solution">
**Time Complexity**: $\mathcal{O}(N)$

This can also be solved using [DFS](/silver/dfs).
Although it is less elegant, it has the subjective advantage
of actually giving a valid planting arrangement for the fields.

<Warning>

Implementing recursion as normal results in stack overflow for the last test case
($10^5$ fields connected together in a single chain). To remedy this, we use our own
stack.

</Warning>

```py
with open("planting.in") as read:
	field_num = int(read.readline())
	neighbors = [[] for _ in range(field_num)]
	for _ in range(field_num - 1):
		field1, field2 = [int(i) - 1 for i in read.readline().split()]
		neighbors[field1].append(field2)
		neighbors[field2].append(field1)

grass_type = [0 for _ in range(field_num)]
# Set our starting field to be type 1.
grass_type[0] = 1

todo = [(0, 0)]
while todo:
	at, prev = todo.pop()
	# Start with grass type 1.
	type_num = 1
	for n in neighbors[at]:
		if n == prev:
			continue

		# While the current grass type is being used, increment it.
		while type_num in [grass_type[at], grass_type[prev]]:
			type_num += 1

		# Set the grass type for the neighboring field.
		grass_type[n] = type_num

		# Recursively color the other fields.
		todo.append((n, at))

		# We can't use this type again.
		type_num += 1

print(max(grass_type), file=open("planting.out", "w"))

    What is the space complexity for adjacency lists and adjacency matrices respectively? Let $n$ be the total number of nodes and $m$ be the total number of edges.
    <Quiz.Answer correct>
      $\mathcal{O}(n + m)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
      <Quiz.Explanation>
        Correct. An adjacency list consists of $n$ dynamic arrays, where the total sum of their lengths is $m$. Thus, since there are $n$ references and $m$ total elements for each edge, it has a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$. An adjacency matrix is an $n \times n$ matrix, leading us to an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space complexity.
